# launch-mc
Windows scripts for launching and updating Minecraft clients

The scripts here are specific to our organization's needs. This means
we target our specific Minecraft versions (1.19.4 and 1.16.5 as of 2025-03-27),
and our desktop shortcuts have names and icons that make sense for us.
Please fork and modify the repo as necessary according to your personal preferences.

# Implementation

We use the [portablemc](https://github.com/mindstorm38/portablemc) Python package.
